## What is streaming classification?

Instead of traditional image classification datasets which train on thousands of independent images per object, we built a dataset made up of dozens of small snippets of videos.

Training a classification model in this way forces the model to generalize from highly correlated images and approximates how real-time agents must learn to classify objects.  

## Why include novelty detection?

In addition to streaming data we also establish protocols for novel object identification by including novel classes in our evaluation set that are unseen during the training sequences.

## What does our dataset contain?
